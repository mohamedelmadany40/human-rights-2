<section class="reveal"><h2>What Are Human Rights?</h2>
<p>Human rights are moral principles or social norms that describe a model of human behavior, generally understood as a set of fundamental rights that must not be violated. They are inherent and inalienable to every person simply by virtue of being human. These rights are inseparable from people regardless of their identity, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status. Their protection is organized as legal rights within the framework of both domestic and international laws.
They are universal, apply everywhere and at all times, and are equal for all people. They require empathy, solidarity, and the rule of law, and they impose on individuals the duty to respect the human rights of others. They cannot and should not be taken away except as a result of due legal procedures that safeguard rights and under specific circumstances. For example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution.
They recognize for all members of the human family the inherent dignity and value within them. By acknowledging these freedoms, individuals can enjoy security and safety, and become able to make decisions that organize their lives. The recognition of the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of the human family is considered a fundamental pillar for freedom, justice, and the achievement of peace in the world.

<section class="reveal"><p>Disregarding or neglecting human rights leads to disasters against humanity and barbaric acts that cause deep wounds and scars in the human conscience. Therefore, it is necessary and obligatory that international and national laws and legislations protect human rights, so that people are not forced, in the end, to revolt against tyranny and injustice, and so that the world and humanity do not witness further catastrophes against human rights and the collective human conscience
There is no single, universally accepted definition of human rights. Instead, the meaning often varies across societies and cultures, since the idea of human rights is deeply tied to how each community understands the nature of the human being. Over time, many thinkers and scholars have tried to capture the essence of this concept.
For example, René Cassin—one of the main drafters of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights—saw human rights as a branch of the social sciences that studies relationships among people based on human dignity, identifying the rights and freedoms necessary for every person’s development. Others, however, argue that human rights are a contradictory bundle of claims and entitlements.

<section class="reveal"><p>Karel Vasak described them as a field relevant to every person, especially the worker living within a state, who must be protected by both national and international law if accused of breaking the law or caught in war. For him, equality was central, though always balanced with public order.
Similarly, Yves Madieu considered human rights to be about recognizing personal rights, both nationally and internationally, that ensure dignity is respected while maintaining public order. The Hungarian jurist Imre Szabó went further, describing them as a blend of constitutional and international law aimed at directly protecting individuals against abuses of power, while also fostering the conditions needed for a full human life and personal growth.
Arab scholars have also provided insightful perspectives. Mohammed Abdul Malik Mutawakkil defined human rights as a set of entitlements owed equally to all people without discrimination. Radwan Ziadeh emphasized their natural basis—such as the right to life and equality—anchored in international charters. Basil Youssef framed them as the product of centuries of philosophy, faiths, and traditions, representing universal values that protect human freedom and survival. Meanwhile, Mohammed Al-Majzoub highlighted that these rights are natural and inseparable from human beings, existing even if unrecognized or violated by authority.

<section class="reveal"><p>The United Nations takes a more legalistic view, defining human rights as universal guarantees that shield individuals and groups from government actions that undermine fundamental freedoms and human dignity. In short, the UN sees them as rights inherent to human nature itself—without them, a person cannot truly live as a human being.
However, they are not always effective, and many of them fail to fully guarantee certain rights. This is where international standards step in, ensuring that these rights are upheld when governments fall short of protecting them.
The United Nations, whose mission is to maintain international peace and security, has established most of the international laws that recognize and protect human rights. Nearly every independent country in the world holds a seat at the UN, which—along with other Another factor that has helped spread awareness of human rights across the globe is globalization. Simply put, globalization connects human societies through the exchange of cultures, trade, and media—including newspapers, the internet, and television

<p>In 1948, the United Nations adopted the 
<strong>
Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)
</strong>
, which set out, for the first time, 
fundamental human rights to be universally protected. It remains one of the most translated and widely recognized documents in the world, 
consisting of 30 articles that cover civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights.</p>

<section class="reveal"><p>1️⃣ The Threefold Classification:
Personal Safety Rights: Guarantee the right to life, liberty, and personal security; prohibit slavery, torture, and arbitrary arrest or detention.
Civil Liberties: Protect freedom of opinion and expression, freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as the right to peaceful assembly. They also include political rights such as voting, holding public office, and the right to marry and found a family.
Social and Economic Rights: Ensure access to basic human needs such as food, housing, clothing, healthcare, and education, along with the right to work, form and join trade unions, and the right to social progress.</p>
<p>2️⃣ The Fourfold Classification (based on the UDHR):</p>
<p> Category I: Individual and personal rights.</p>
<p>Category II: Rights related to the individual’s relationship with society or the state.</p>

<section class="reveal"><h2>The Role of the United Nations in Safeguarding Human Rights</h2>
<p>1️⃣ International Treaties</p>
<p>•	Drafted by the Human Rights Commission and adopted by the General Assembly.</p>
<p>•	Key treaties: ICCPR (1966), ICESCR (1966).</p>
<p>•	Other treaties: CEDAW (women), CRC (children), CAT (torture), Refugee Convention, treatment of prisoners.</p>
<p>2️⃣ Relief and Assistance</p>
<p>•	Providing food, shelter, medical aid when states fail.</p>
<p>•	Supporting governments with educational programs, technical and legal experts</p>
<p>•	Sending election observers and training prison/ police officials.</p>
<p>3️⃣ Monitoring (Treaty Bodies)</p>
<p>•	Reviewing states’ reports on treaty implementation.</p>
<p>•	Fact-finding missions and reports to the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly.</p>
<p>4️⃣ Diplomatic and Economic Measures</p>
<p>•	Imposing sanctions on states that persistently violate rights.</p>
<p>•	Example: sanctions against apartheid South Africa.</p>
<p>5️⃣ Peacekeeping</p>
<p>•	Deploying peacekeepers with the consent of conflicting parties.</p>
<p>•	Example: overseeing East Timor’s independence in 1999</p>
<p>6️⃣ War Crimes Tribunals</p>

<h2>Human Rights Today</h2>
<p>Despite the progress made in abolishing slavery and establishing international human rights law, challenges remain. 
Modern slavery still exists in the form of human trafficking, forced labor, and child exploitation. 
According to international organizations, over 40 million people worldwide are estimated to live in conditions of modern slavery.</p>
<p>Human rights defenders continue to fight for justice, equality, and freedom across the globe. 
Ensuring access to education, protecting refugees, promoting gender equality, and fighting against racism and discrimination 
are among the most urgent issues in the 21st century.</p>
<h2>Categories of Human Rights</h2>
<p>Human rights are not static; they evolve with societies. Researchers often classify them in different ways:</p>
<p>•	By importance: fundamental rights (like the right to life and freedom) versus non-fundamental rights.</p>
<p>•	By beneficiaries: individual rights (belonging to each person) versus collective rights (belonging to groups or peoples).</p>
<p>•	By subject matter: civil and political rights (freedom of speech, fair trial, participation in politics) versus economic, social, and cultural rights (education, health, work, social security).</p>
<p>•	Modern “solidarity rights”: newer rights that focus on collective well-being, such as the right to development, to a clean environment, and to peace.</p>
<p> In short, human rights protection is a shared responsibility between international organizations, regional bodies, independent NGOs, and—most importantly—ordinary people demanding dignity and justice.</p>
<h2>Human Rights and Cultural Differences</h2>
<p>Some governments claim that universal human rights standards conflict with their cultural or traditional values. But the United Nations makes it clear: while it respects cultural diversity, it does not accept practices that violate the dignity or basic rights of individuals.</p>
<p>Victims of abuse themselves rarely see any contradiction between their traditions and universal human rights—they simply want their rights as human beings to be respected.</p>
